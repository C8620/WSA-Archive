# WSA-Archive

This is a public repo that have saved all downloadable builds of Windows Subsystem of Android (WSA) at 08 March 2024, following Microsoft's announcement of discontinuance.

The purpose of saving and uploading these files is to allow users who need them to install WSA themselves, since it is not possible anymore to enrol WSA Insider and install these builds.

Builds could be downloaded from Releases of this repo.

These packages are provided as-is and I do not provide support or burden liability for its suitability on your computers. These releases uses Android 13 and should be working for some foreseeable years.
